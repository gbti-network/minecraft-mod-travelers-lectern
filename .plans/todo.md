Sprint 4

# Travelers Chest

* Make sure parial stacks are repaired. 
* Make sure that added items by other players are not destroyed on chest renew.


# Travelers Lectern

* When right clicking on a book on a normal lectern it allows you to read the book and gives an option of taking it. The Travelers Lectern, when right clicking on a book, dislodges the book immediately. I'd like the travelers lectern to offer the same reading/taking functionality as a normal lectern.
